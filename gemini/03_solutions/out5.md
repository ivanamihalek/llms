Can you please make this code more efficient?
```python
    
# Returns index of x in arr if present, else -1
def binary_search(arr, low, high, x):
    # Check base case
    if high >= low:
        mid = (high + low) // 2
        if arr[mid] == x:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] > x:
            return binary_search(arr, low, mid - 1, x)
        else:
            return binary_search(arr, mid + 1, high, x)
    else:
        return -1

# Test array
arr = [ 2, 3, 4, 10, 40 ]
x = 10

# Function call
result = binary_search(arr, 0, len(arr)-1, x)

if result != -1:
    print("Element is present at index", str(result))
else:
    print("Element is not present in array")

Explain in detail what you changed and why.
    
The provided code implements a recursive binary search. While functional, recursion can be less efficient than an iterative approach, especially for large arrays, due to function call overhead.  The primary inefficiency is the repeated function calls.

Here's an improved, iterative version:

```python
def binary_search_iterative(arr, x):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1
    mid = 0

    while low <= high:
        mid = (high + low) // 2  # Integer division

        # If x is greater, ignore left half
        if arr[mid] < x:
            low = mid + 1

        # If x is smaller, ignore right half
        elif arr[mid] > x:
            high = mid - 1

        # means x is present at mid
        else:
            return mid

    # If we reach here, then the element was not present
    return -1

# Test array
arr = [2, 3, 4, 10, 40]
x = 10

# Function call
result = binary_search_iterative(arr, x)

if result != -1:
    print("Element is present at index", str(result))
else:
    print("Element is not present in array")
```

**Changes and Explanations:**

1. **Iterative Approach:** The most significant change is replacing the recursive calls with a `while` loop. This eliminates the overhead of creating new stack frames for each recursive call, making it significantly faster for larger arrays.

2. **Simplified Logic:** The iterative version directly updates `low` and `high` within the loop, making the code cleaner and easier to understand.  The conditional logic is streamlined.

3. **Removed Redundant Arguments:** The iterative version takes only the array and the target value (`x`) as arguments.  The `low` and `high` indices are managed internally within the loop. This simplifies the function signature.

4. **Integer Division:** The line `mid = (high + low) // 2` uses integer division (`//`). This ensures that `mid` is always an integer, preventing potential issues with floating-point arithmetic.  While the original code likely worked correctly, this is a best practice for clarity and to avoid potential subtle errors.


**Why the iterative version is more efficient:**

* **No function call overhead:** Recursive calls involve pushing and popping stack frames, consuming time and memory.  The iterative approach avoids this entirely.
* **Better memory management:**  Recursive calls can lead to stack overflow errors for very large arrays. The iterative approach uses constant stack space regardless of the array size.
* **Potentially faster execution:**  The elimination of function call overhead directly translates to faster execution times, especially noticeable with larger input arrays.


In summary, the iterative binary search is generally preferred over the recursive version due to its improved efficiency in terms of both time and space complexity.  The recursive version is primarily useful for demonstrating the concept of recursion, but for practical applications, the iterative approach is almost always the better choice.
