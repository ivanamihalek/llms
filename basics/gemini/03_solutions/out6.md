Can you please help me to debug this code?
```python

class Node:
   def __init__(self, data):
      self.data = data
      self.next = None
      self.prev = None

class doubly_linked_list:
   def __init__(self):
      self.head = None

# Adding data elements
   def push(self, NewVal):
      NewNode = Node(NewVal)
      NewNode.next = self.head
      if self.head is not None:
         self.head.prev = NewNode
      self.head = NewNode

# Print the Doubly Linked list in order
   def listprint(self, node):
       print(node.data),
       last = node
       node = node.next

dllist = doubly_linked_list()
dllist.push(12)
dllist.push(8)
dllist.push(62)
dllist.listprint(dllist.head)


```
Explain in detail what you found and why it was a bug.
    
The primary bug lies within the `listprint` method.  It correctly prints the data of the first node, but then it has a logic error that prevents it from traversing and printing the rest of the list.

**The Bug:**

The `listprint` function attempts to iterate through the list, but it doesn't handle the termination condition properly.  The line `node = node.next` correctly moves to the next node, but there's no check to see if `node` has become `None` (meaning the end of the list has been reached).  As a result, it will eventually try to access `node.data` when `node` is `None`, causing a `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'data'` error.

**The Fix:**

We need to add a loop that continues as long as `node` is not `None`.  Here's the corrected code:

```python
class Node:
   def __init__(self, data):
      self.data = data
      self.next = None
      self.prev = None

class doubly_linked_list:
   def __init__(self):
      self.head = None

# Adding data elements
   def push(self, NewVal):
      NewNode = Node(NewVal)
      NewNode.next = self.head
      if self.head is not None:
         self.head.prev = NewNode
      self.head = NewNode

# Print the Doubly Linked list in order
   def listprint(self, node):
       while node is not None:  # Added loop condition
           print(node.data, end=" ") #Added end=" " for better formatting
           node = node.next

dllist = doubly_linked_list()
dllist.push(12)
dllist.push(8)
dllist.push(62)
dllist.listprint(dllist.head)
```

**Explanation of the Fix:**

The `while node is not None:` loop ensures that the printing continues only while there are nodes left to process.  The loop terminates gracefully when `node` becomes `None`, preventing the `AttributeError`. I also added `end=" "` to the `print` function to make the output more readable, printing the numbers separated by spaces instead of each on a new line.


This corrected version will correctly print the entire doubly linked list in order: `62 8 12` (Note the reverse order due to the `push` operation adding to the beginning).
